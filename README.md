# digital-church-sermons

This plugin sets up a custom post type for Sermons and Sermon Series. It also creates a custom Sermon Series taxonomy. All custom fields are reliant on Meta Box (metabox.io). No post styles are included as I use Beaver Themer and Beaver Builder for all my theme development.

This plugin also includes settings for On-Air/Off-Air times for live streaming and the scripts and style necessarry for a recurring timer and the ability to show or hide elements at certain times with an .on-air or .off-air class.
